This is a wip demo of [Playline](https://github.com/pappleby/playline) - a wip port of Yarn Spinner to the Playdate!

It uses [Noble Engine](https://github.com/NobleRobot/NobleEngine) to help get things up and running.

Sideload the [latest release](https://github.com/pappleby/playlinedemo/releases/tag/v0.0.2-wip) to try it out on real hardware!
